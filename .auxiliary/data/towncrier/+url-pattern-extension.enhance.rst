Add automatic URL pattern extension for documentation sites. The system now automatically discovers working documentation URLs when the base URL fails, significantly improving compatibility with ReadTheDocs, GitHub Pages, and other hosting platforms that use versioned paths like ``/en/latest/`` or ``/latest/``. Previously failing sites like ``requests.readthedocs.io`` and ``docs.pydantic.dev`` now work seamlessly with transparent URL resolution.
