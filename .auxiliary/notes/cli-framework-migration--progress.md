## Design and Style Conformance Checklist

- [ ] Module organization follows practices guidelines
- [ ] Function signatures use wide parameter, narrow return patterns
- [ ] Type annotations comprehensive with TypeAlias patterns
- [ ] Exception handling follows Omniexception â†’ Omnierror hierarchy
- [ ] Naming follows nomenclature conventions
- [ ] Immutability preferences applied
- [ ] Code style follows formatting guidelines

## Implementation Progress Checklist

### Phase 1: DisplayOptions Extension
- [x] Extend DisplayOptions from appcore.cli.DisplayOptions
- [x] Add librovore-specific format field
- [x] Implement decide_rich_markdown compatibility method
- [x] Update imports in cli.py
- [x] Replace decide_rich_markdown calls with determine_colorization
- [x] Remove custom stream/file handling logic

### Phase 2: Application Base Class Migration
- [x] Update Cli class to inherit from appcore.cli.Application
- [x] Add display field with DisplayOptions
- [x] Implement execute method with extension registration
- [x] Remove prepare_invocation_args method
- [x] Remove custom __call__ method
- [x] Update command invocation pattern
- [x] Implement custom prepare method for cache proxy setup
- [x] Remove _prepare function entirely

### Phase 3: Command Protocol Standardization
- [x] Update DetectCommand to inherit from appcore.cli.Command
- [x] Update QueryInventoryCommand to inherit from appcore.cli.Command
- [x] Update QueryContentCommand to inherit from appcore.cli.Command
- [x] Update SurveyProcessorsCommand to inherit from appcore.cli.Command
- [x] Update ServeCommand to inherit from appcore.cli.Command
- [x] Remove custom __call__ implementations from commands
- [x] Preserve @intercept_errors decorators
- [x] Create ApplicationGlobals class extending _state.Globals with display field
- [x] Convert __call__ methods to execute methods with isinstance type guards
- [x] Update method signatures from (auxdata, display) to (auxdata) where auxdata.display provides display

### Integration Testing
- [x] CLI interface behavior remains identical
- [x] All commands function correctly
- [x] Error handling works as expected
- [x] Format rendering (JSON/Markdown) unchanged
- [x] New framework features working (inscription, configfile, environment)

## Quality Gates Checklist

- [x] Linters pass (`hatch --env develop run linters`)
- [x] Type checker passes
- [x] Tests pass (`hatch --env develop run testers`)
- [x] Code review ready

## Decision Log

- 2025-01-26 Starting with Phase 1 only - Incremental approach to minimize risk
- 2025-01-26 Preserving @intercept_errors decorator - Domain-specific error handling critical to librovore
- 2025-01-26 Keeping existing format logic - JSON/Markdown distinction core to interface
- 2025-01-26 Phase 2 completed - Implemented custom prepare method to maintain cache proxy functionality
- 2025-01-26 Used TypeError for type validation instead of assert for linter compliance
- 2025-01-26 Code review feedback addressed:
  - Removed decide_rich_markdown() compatibility method per review
  - Used framework determine_colorization() directly
  - Documented NO_COLOR limitation for upstream enhancement
  - Created ContextInvalidity exception and used isinstance check for proper type narrowing
- 2025-01-26 Phase 3 completed - All command classes migrated to appcore.cli.Command framework
  - Implemented Globals extending _state.Globals with display field
  - All commands now inherit from _appcore_cli.Command with execute() methods
  - Proper type narrowing with isinstance checks instead of type casting
  - Preserved @intercept_errors decorators for domain-specific error handling
- 2025-01-27 Type annotation compatibility resolved
  - Added `from __future__ import annotations` to resolve runtime subscripting issues
  - Fixed test framework calls to use new command signature pattern
  - All linters pass: 0 errors, 0 warnings, 0 informations
  - All tests pass: 175 passed, comprehensive test coverage maintained
- 2025-01-27 DisplayOptions architectural refactor completed
  - Moved DisplayOptions class from cli.py to state.py for proper separation of concerns
  - Added display field to Globals class in state.py, eliminating duplicate Globals class in cli.py
  - Updated all imports and references to use _state.DisplayOptions (private module access)
  - Fixed test framework to import from correct module
  - Architecture now follows proper module responsibility patterns

## Handoff Notes

### Current State
- **Phase 1 COMPLETED**: DisplayOptions extends appcore.cli.DisplayOptions with clean imports
- **Phase 2 COMPLETED**: Cli class inherits from appcore.cli.Application
- **Phase 3 COMPLETED**: All command classes migrated to appcore.cli.Command framework
- Framework integration successful - eliminated 40+ lines of boilerplate code
- New capabilities: configfile, environment, rich inscription (logging) control
- All existing functionality preserved and tested
- Cache proxy functionality maintained through custom prepare method
- Command protocol fully standardized with proper type safety

### Next Steps
1. Optional: Implement Phase 4 (Inscription unification) for MCP server consistency
2. Consider additional framework enhancements or optimizations
3. Migration fully complete and ready for production use

### Known Issues
- None identified yet

### Context Dependencies
- Migration plan requires preserving existing CLI interface behavior
- Framework compatibility confirmed through appcore source code analysis
- Reference implementation available in appcore.introspection module
