# Current Status

## Recently Completed ‚úÖ

### 1. Query Documentation Implementation
- **CLI Command**: Added `QueryDocumentationCommand` with full parameter support
- **MCP Tool**: Added `query_documentation` async function with proper Field annotations  
- **Core Logic**: Implemented comprehensive filtering and relevance ranking
- **Helper Functions**: Added relevance scoring and content snippet extraction

### 2. Code Quality Improvements
- **Type Aliases**: Added MCP server type aliases with Pydantic Field annotations
- **Enum Migration**: Moved `MatchMode` enum to `interfaces` module for shared usage
- **MCP Server**: Updated to use enum types directly (Pydantic handles serialization)
- **Test Updates**: Updated all tests to use enum values, maintaining string output validation

### 3. Output Format Cleanup
- **Removed `output_format` parameter**: Extract documentation now only outputs markdown
- **Simplified API**: Eliminated unnecessary format options per user feedback

### 4. Test Coverage Expansion
- **Query Documentation Tests**: Added comprehensive test coverage for all `query_documentation` parameters and functionality
- **Edge Cases**: Added tests for empty queries, nonexistent files, match modes, filtering combinations
- **Error Handling**: Added tests for graceful error handling and exception scenarios
- **116 Total Tests**: All tests pass with clean linting and type checking
- **Coverage Improvement**: Overall 75% (from 63%), functions.py 78% (from 56%)

### 5. Test Performance Optimization
- **pyfakefs Caching**: Session-scoped fixture copies inventory files to memory
- **Reduced I/O**: Tests use cached files instead of repeated filesystem access
- **Structured Fixtures**: Proper setup for fast test execution

## Key Features Working ‚úÖ

1. **Documentation Querying**: Full text search with relevance ranking
2. **Filtering**: Domain, role, priority, match mode (exact/regex/fuzzy)
3. **Content Snippets**: Contextual text extraction around matches
4. **Type Safety**: Proper enum usage with MCP protocol compatibility
5. **CLI/MCP Parity**: Both interfaces support identical functionality

## Test Coverage Challenges üß™

Despite adding 23 new test cases, coverage improvement was modest (+12% overall). Key observations:
- **Many tests hit same code paths**: Basic functionality tests overlap significantly
- **Missing edge cases**: Remaining uncovered lines are in error handling and HTTP paths
- **Test performance**: Even "fast" tests are slow due to filesystem operations and inventory parsing
- **Effectiveness gap**: Large test addition for relatively small coverage gains

### Strategies for Better Coverage
1. **Target specific uncovered lines**: Use coverage HTML report to identify exact missing paths
2. **Mock heavy operations**: Replace actual inventory parsing with mocks for unit tests
3. **Integration vs unit testing**: Separate fast unit tests from slower integration tests
4. **Error injection**: Focus on exception paths and edge cases

## Remaining Tasks üìã

### High Priority
1. **Type Alias Consolidation**: Move function argument type aliases to `interfaces` module, eliminate duplication between `cli` and `functions` modules
2. **Test Strategy Refinement**: Implement more targeted testing approach for better coverage/effort ratio

### Medium Priority  
3. **Code Style**: Remove obvious comments, eliminate blank lines in function bodies, fix delimiter placement, lexicographical sorting

### Low Priority
4. **Performance**: Consider implementing full-text search using `searchindex.js` for future enhancement

## Technical Notes üîß

- **MCP Protocol**: Successfully confirmed that Pydantic handles enum serialization/deserialization automatically
- **Wire Format**: JSON sends `{"match_mode": "fuzzy"}`, Pydantic converts to `MatchMode.Fuzzy`
- **Type Safety**: Full enum validation and IDE support maintained
- **Test Coverage**: All 76 tests passing with proper enum usage

## Git Status üìù
- Latest commit: "Restore MCP server to use enum types with proper test updates"
- All changes committed and tested
- Ready for next phase of development

## Next Steps üöÄ
When you return, we can discuss:
1. The remaining cleanup tasks from your agenda
2. Test coverage expansion for the new functionality
3. Any additional features or improvements needed
