# Improvements Needed for Project Guides

## Nomenclature Guide Issues

### `validate` Function Naming Convention
**Issue**: The nomenclature guide contains examples that violate its own stated convention for `validate` functions.

**Convention**: Functions named `validate` should raise exceptions if something is invalid, else return their argument.

**Problem**: Current examples in both the nomenclature guide and our code-compliance-reviewer agent show `validate` functions being used in contexts where they appear to return boolean values or be used in conditional logic, which contradicts the stated convention.

**Action Needed**:
- Review all `validate` function examples in the nomenclature guide
- Ensure examples either:
  - Show `validate` functions that raise exceptions and return the validated argument
  - Use different function names (like `is_valid`, `check_validity`) for boolean-returning functions

**Files to Update**:
- nomenclature.rst: Fix examples to comply with stated convention
- Any related documentation that shows `validate` function usage

## Additional Guide Improvements

### Style Guide Additions Needed

1. **Trailing Comma Rules**: Dictionary entries should have trailing comma if multi-line, affecting closing delimiter placement

### Design Pattern Improvements

1. **`collections.defaultdict` Usage**: Consider recommending `defaultdict` over manual dictionary initialization patterns
2. **Type Suppression Review**: Guidelines for when suppressions indicate design problems vs acceptable usage

*Space reserved for future improvements identified during development*
