## Documentation & Developer Experience Issues

### Tyro Mutual Exclusion Groups Documentation Discoverability
**Date:** 2025-09-04  
**Severity:** Medium  
**Component:** Development Tools / Documentation

**Issue:** When implementing CLI display options consolidation with Tyro mutual exclusion groups, the feature was difficult to discover through normal documentation searches. Standard searches for "mutual exclusion groups", "mutually exclusive", and "exclusion" in the Tyro documentation did not return useful results.

**Impact:** 
- Increased development time due to documentation search difficulties
- Required user intervention to provide direct link to relevant documentation
- May discourage adoption of Tyro's advanced features if not easily discoverable

**Current Workaround:** Direct link to source documentation provided by user: https://brentyi.github.io/tyro/_sources/examples/basics.rst.txt

**Suggested Follow-up:**
- Investigate Tyro documentation search functionality and indexing
- Consider contributing documentation improvements to make mutual exclusion groups more discoverable
- Document internal knowledge of Tyro advanced features for future reference

**Related Implementation:** Successfully implemented `tyro.conf.create_mutex_group()` for CLI display options with proper mutual exclusion validation.
