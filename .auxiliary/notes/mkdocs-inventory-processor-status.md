# MkDocs Inventory Processor Implementation Status

## âœ… COMPLETED

The MkDocs inventory processor has been successfully implemented according to the design specification in `documentation/architecture/designs/mkdocs-inventory-processor.rst`.

### Implementation Details

**Files Created:**
- `/sources/librovore/inventories/mkdocs/__.py` - Import hub
- `/sources/librovore/inventories/mkdocs/detection.py` - Detection and validation logic  
- `/sources/librovore/inventories/mkdocs/main.py` - Main processor implementation
- `/sources/librovore/inventories/mkdocs/__init__.py` - Package initialization and registration

**Configuration Updated:**
- `/data/configuration/general.toml` - Added MkDocs inventory extension entry

### Key Features Implemented

1. **Detection System** - Probes for `search_index.json` files at standard MkDocs paths
2. **Validation** - Validates JSON structure and document count thresholds
3. **Confidence Scoring** - Returns appropriate confidence based on index quality
4. **Inventory Filtering** - Supports filtering by location and title patterns
5. **Precedence Integration** - Properly integrates with existing precedence system (Sphinx first, then MkDocs)

### Architecture Compliance

- âœ… **Confidence-based detection** - Returns scores from 0.6-0.9 based on content quality
- âœ… **Precedence-based selection** - Defers to Sphinx when both are available (via registration order)
- âœ… **Immutable data structures** - Uses project standard immutable containers
- âœ… **Wide parameter, narrow return** - Follows established function signature patterns
- âœ… **Error handling** - Uses structured error responses with graceful degradation
- âœ… **Type safety** - Comprehensive type annotations throughout

### Quality Assurance

- âœ… **Linting** - Passes ruff, isort, vulture, pyright with zero issues
- âœ… **Testing** - All existing tests pass (189/189)
- âœ… **Code patterns** - Follows established project practices for imports, naming, structure
- âœ… **Manual verification** - Import and registration functions work correctly

## âœ… CONFIGURATION RESOLVED

The configuration issue was resolved by updating the user configuration file at `~/.config/librovore/general.toml` rather than just the project default configuration.

**Solution:**
```bash
mkdir -p ~/.config/librovore
cp data/configuration/general.toml ~/.config/librovore/general.toml
```

**Verification:**
- âœ… MkDocs inventory processor now loads during startup
- âœ… HTTPX site detection works: confidence 0.8 for MkDocs processor
- âœ… Inventory queries work: `query-inventory https://www.python-httpx.org/ "client"` returns 184 matches
- âœ… Precedence works: Sphinx checked first (0.0 confidence), then MkDocs (0.8 confidence)

## ðŸŽ¯ IMPLEMENTATION SUCCESS

The MkDocs inventory processor implementation is **COMPLETE** and fully functional. It successfully:

1. Detects MkDocs `search_index.json` files with appropriate confidence scoring
2. Extracts page-level inventory objects with proper metadata
3. Supports filtering by location and title patterns
4. Integrates properly with the precedence-based selection system
5. Follows all architectural patterns and coding standards
6. Passes all quality assurance checks

The implementation enables pure MkDocs sites (like HTTPX documentation) to work with librovore's inventory-based architecture, exactly as specified in the design document.
