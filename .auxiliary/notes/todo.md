# Release 1.0 TODO - Sphinx MCP Server

## Code Quality & Maintenance (Medium Priority)

### üß™ Testing Strategy Improvements
- [x] **Reduce test overlap**: Target specific uncovered lines instead of comprehensive functionality tests
- [ ] **Mock heavy operations**: Replace inventory parsing with mocks for unit tests
- [ ] **Focus on hard gaps**: Mock HTTP/network failures for error path testing

## API Stability (High Priority)

### üöÄ Current Agenda (Post-Consolidation)
- [ ] **MkDocs processor**: Implement second processor for MkDocs-generated sites
- [ ] **Real-world testing**: Try Sphinx processor on various sites for additional UX improvements

### üìñ Documentation
- [ ] **API documentation**: Complete documentation for all public interfaces
- [ ] **Plugin development guide**: Documentation for creating custom plugins
- [ ] **Usage examples**: Real-world examples for common use cases
- [ ] **Migration guide**: If any breaking changes are needed before 1.0

## Performance & Production Readiness (Medium Priority)

### ‚ö° Performance
- [ ] **Async optimization**: Ensure all network operations are properly async
- [ ] **Connection pooling**: Reuse HTTP connections for multiple requests
- [ ] **Parallel operations**: Allow concurrent inventory/documentation fetching
- [ ] **Memory efficiency**: Profile and optimize memory usage for large inventories

### üõ°Ô∏è Production Features
- [ ] **Error handling robustness**: Comprehensive error handling for all failure modes

## Release Preparation (Low Priority)

### üì¶ Package Management
- [ ] **Version pinning**: Lock dependency versions for stability
- [ ] **Package metadata**: Complete pyproject.toml with proper classifiers
- [ ] **Distribution testing**: Test installation from PyPI test server
- [ ] **Documentation publishing**: Ensure docs build and publish correctly

### üîç Quality Assurance
- [ ] **Integration testing**: End-to-end testing with real documentation sites
- [ ] **Cross-platform testing**: Ensure compatibility across OS platforms
- [ ] **Performance benchmarking**: Establish baseline performance metrics
- [ ] **Security review**: Review for potential security issues

## Post-1.0 Considerations

### üåü Extension Ideas (Not for 1.0)
- Interactive CLI browser mode
- Multi-site search capabilities
- Advanced relationship mapping between objects

## Test Analysis Integration

## Success Criteria for 1.0

- [ ] **API stability** with semantic versioning commitment
- [ ] **90%+ test coverage** through targeted testing strategy
- [ ] **Production ready** with proper error handling and performance
- [ ] **Documentation complete** for users and plugin developers
