*******************************************************************************
Structure Processors Architecture  
*******************************************************************************

Overview
===============================================================================

Structure processors extract content from documentation pages and transform it 
into structured documents suitable for search and analysis. These processors 
form the content extraction layer of librovore's architecture, working with 
inventory objects to provide comprehensive documentation access.

**Role in content extraction pipeline**: Structure processors serve as the 
bridge between inventory object discovery and actual content access. They 
convert HTML documentation pages into structured, searchable content while 
preserving semantic information and cross-references.

**Relationship to inventory processors**: Structure processors consume inventory 
objects created by inventory processors, using the object metadata and URIs 
to guide content extraction. The relationship is mediated through capability-based 
filtering to ensure inventory objects are only processed by compatible structure 
processors.

**Inventory-type awareness principles**: Structure processors advertise their 
compatibility with specific inventory types and content formats, enabling 
intelligent routing of extraction requests. This prevents processing failures 
and optimizes extraction quality by matching processors to their optimal 
content sources.

Architecture Patterns
===============================================================================

Content Extraction Dataflow
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Structure processors follow a consistent content extraction pipeline regardless 
of the underlying documentation format:

error handling, and retry mechanisms for robust content access.

**HTML Processing**: Format-specific HTML content extraction that understands 
documentation theme layouts, navigation structures, and content organization patterns.

**Document Creation**: Transformation of extracted content into structured documents 
with preserved metadata, cross-references, and searchable text content.

URL Construction Patterns
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Structure processors implement intelligent URL construction that accommodates 
diverse documentation site organizations:

**Base URL Resolution**: Consistent handling of documentation base URLs with 
support for subdirectory installations, CDN distributions, and alternative 
hosting arrangements.

**Relative Path Handling**: Proper resolution of inventory object URIs relative 
to documentation base URLs with consideration for URL encoding, fragment 
identifiers, and query parameters.

**Context-Aware Construction**: URL building that considers documentation site 
structure including version-specific paths, language variants, and theme-specific 
URL patterns.

**Fallback Strategies**: Alternative URL construction approaches when primary 
patterns fail, including probe-based discovery and heuristic URL derivation.

HTML Processing and Conversion
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Content extraction accommodates the diversity of documentation site layouts 
and themes through adaptive processing strategies:

**Theme Recognition**: Detection of documentation themes and frameworks to 
optimize content extraction for specific layout patterns and markup conventions.

**Content Identification**: Intelligent identification of main content areas 
within documentation pages, distinguishing content from navigation, advertising, 
and decorative elements.

**Semantic Preservation**: Extraction that preserves semantic markup including 
headings, code blocks, cross-references, and structured content elements.

**Cleanup and Normalization**: Content sanitization that removes theme-specific 
artifacts while preserving essential formatting and structural information.

Error Handling and Fallback Strategies
