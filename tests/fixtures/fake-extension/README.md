# Fake Extension Package

Test package for extension manager testing. This package simulates a real extension with:

- Basic processor implementation
- Entry point registration
- .pth file processing
- Minimal dependencies

Used by the xtnsmgr test suite to validate extension installation, caching, and loading.
